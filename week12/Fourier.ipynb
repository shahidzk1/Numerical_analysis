    "There are two types of situation in which it is particularly useful to think of a time series of observations as a sum of sinusoids:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When one knows, based on physical considerations, that the big signal really is very accurately expressed as a sum of a few sinusoids of known frequency.  The tides are a perfect example; astronomical forcing occurs at very well-defined and well-known frequencies, so the ocean responds at those frequencies.\n",
    "- In the opposite situation, when there is little or no perceptible periodicity or other organization, and when a record from one time period looks similar in character, but entirely different in specifics, to that from another time period.  An example is the measurement of almost any variable in a turbulent flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first of these cases, one might analyze the time series by using a least-squares procedure to find out the amplitude and phase of each of the known sinusoids.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, one wants to find out how the energy is distributed among a range of frequencies.  For this, the Fourier transform is tailor-made.  It's worth taking some time to understand what it is and how it works.  We will concentrate on the discrete transform and its inverse; they are what we use in practice for data analysis.  The concepts generalize easily to continuous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a linear algebra point of view, and start with a trivial time series: a variable $y$ sampled at only two times, $t_0$ and $t_1$.  The variable can be plotted as a vector--a point--in 2-D space, with one axis for $y_0 = y(t_0)$ and a second for $y_1 = y(t_1)$.  Remember, this is not a physical space, it is an information space; there are two independent pieces of information required to fully specify $y$. The axes are perpendicular.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification of $y$ is not unique; the same vector could be expressed as the sum of components along axes rotated by some angle relative to the originals.  Rotating by 45 degrees CCW makes the first axis $(\\sqrt{2}/2) [1, 1]\\; $ and a subsequent reflection makes the second axis $(\\sqrt{2}/2) [1, -1]\\; $, where we are expressing the unit vectors of the new axes in terms of the unit vectors of the old. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let that first axis be the top row in a matrix, $M$, and let the second be the bottom row. Then if $y'$ is $y$ expressed in terms of the rotated axes, we have $y' = My\\,$.  $M$ is orthonormal--its inverse is its transpose--so $y = M^{T}y'\\:$.  Notice that $y$ and $y'$ are describing the same vector, but in terms of its projection onto different sets of unit vectors.  The first axis of $y'$ is proportional to the average of $y$ and the second axis is proportional to the difference, $y_0 - y_1 $ ."

    "Now generalize this picture.  Instead of two times, let there be 3, or 4, or any finite number.  Above 3 we can no longer use the visual analogy of mapping each time to a spatial dimension, but the mathematics stays the same.  If we have $N$ data points, we can always express those $N$ pieces of information by projecting them onto $N$ linearly independent (orthogonal) axes.  Because they are orthogonal, this projection is identical to a least-squares fit of the vector $y$ to the new set of axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the case $N=2\\:$: with 2 points in the record, if we imagine that the record is extended by repeating the same pair of points again and again, we have two possible periodicities: zero cycles, or 1 full cycle in the original record length.  Using the sample spacing as the time unit, the frequencies are $\\omega_0 = 2 \\pi \\cdot 0/N\\:$ and $\\omega_1 = 2 \\pi \\cdot 1/N\\:$ radians per unit time.  The matrix $M$ then has entries $M_{nk} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\cos{(2 \\pi n k/2)} \\; $ . \n",
    "\n",
    "For $N > 2$, should we continue this pattern using cosines?  We could, yielding a cosine transform; but we can do better by noting that except for the zero frequency and the $N/2$ cycles per record length frequency (keeping $N$ even henceforth for simplicity), it makes more sense to continue selecting frequencies with an integral number of  cycles per record length, and to let each have a cosine component and a sine component, hence an amplitude and a phase.  This yields the discrete Fourier transform. "

In such cases, we are usually interested in knowing the spectral character of the data, often described with an analogy to the visual spectrum.  A white time series is one with roughly uniform variance per unit frequency; a red spectrum is weighted towards low frequencies; and a blue spectrum is weighted toward high frequencies."
