    "There are two types of situation in which it is particularly useful to think of a time series of observations as a sum of sinusoids:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When one knows, based on physical considerations, that the big signal really is very accurately expressed as a sum of a few sinusoids of known frequency.  The tides are a perfect example; astronomical forcing occurs at very well-defined and well-known frequencies, so the ocean responds at those frequencies.\n",
    "- In the opposite situation, when there is little or no perceptible periodicity or other organization, and when a record from one time period looks similar in character, but entirely different in specifics, to that from another time period.  An example is the measurement of almost any variable in a turbulent flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first of these cases, one might analyze the time series by using a least-squares procedure to find out the amplitude and phase of each of the known sinusoids.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, one wants to find out how the energy is distributed among a range of frequencies.  For this, the Fourier transform is tailor-made.  It's worth taking some time to understand what it is and how it works.  We will concentrate on the discrete transform and its inverse; they are what we use in practice for data analysis.  The concepts generalize easily to continuous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a linear algebra point of view, and start with a trivial time series: a variable $y$ sampled at only two times, $t_0$ and $t_1$.  The variable can be plotted as a vector--a point--in 2-D space, with one axis for $y_0 = y(t_0)$ and a second for $y_1 = y(t_1)$.  Remember, this is not a physical space, it is an information space; there are two independent pieces of information required to fully specify $y$. The axes are perpendicular.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification of $y$ is not unique; the same vector could be expressed as the sum of components along axes rotated by some angle relative to the originals.  Rotating by 45 degrees CCW makes the first axis $(\\sqrt{2}/2) [1, 1]\\; $ and a subsequent reflection makes the second axis $(\\sqrt{2}/2) [1, -1]\\; $, where we are expressing the unit vectors of the new axes in terms of the unit vectors of the old. \n",

    "Let that first axis be the top row in a matrix, $M$, and let the second be the bottom row. Then if $y'$ is $y$ expressed in terms of the rotated axes, we have $y' = My\\,$.  $M$ is orthonormal--its inverse is its transpose--so $y = M^{T}y'\\:$.  Notice that $y$ and $y'$ are describing the same vector, but in terms of its projection onto different sets of unit vectors.

Above 3 we can no longer use the visual analogy of mapping each time to a spatial dimension, but the mathematics stays the same.  If we have $N$ data points, we can always express those $N$ pieces of information by projecting them onto $N$ linearly independent (orthogonal) axes.  Because they are orthogonal, this projection is identical to a least-squares fit of the vector $y$ to the new set of axes.\n",

In such cases, we are usually interested in knowing the spectral character of the data, often described with an analogy to the visual spectrum.  A white time series is one with roughly uniform variance per unit frequency; a red spectrum is weighted towards low frequencies; and a blue spectrum is weighted toward high frequencies."

We can put a step in the middle, however, to attenuate or remove the energy at some frequencies, thereby filtering the signal.  We will illustrate this here using a sharp low-pass cutoff.  The pulse will be the first guinea pig.  The effect of the sharp cutoff will be more clear with a longer time series, hence the choice of 256 points."

    "## Spectral Analysis\n",
    "We are familiar with thinking about light in terms of its color content, and sound, especially music, in terms of its frequency content.  We do the same with geophysical time series--we describe them, break them up, or filter them based on frequency.  More generally, this can be extended to the spatial dimensions.  The spectrum of ocean surface gravity waves can be described in terms of wavelength or wavenumber, although this brings in the additional complication that wavenumber is a vector whereas frequency is a scalar.  In any case, we are working with the way energy is distributed among periodic components, and so long as we are considering only a single variable, we care about energy or amplitude, but not about phase.  This is a central point: the autospectrum, which is the topic of this notebook, *discards information about phase*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in all of the following we are making quick plots in script fashion, with no attempt to add the usual niceties such as axis labels and legends.  These plots are intended for your experimentation, not as examples of a product one would use for other than such tutorial purposes.  Time scales are in days, frequencies are in cycles per day, given hourly data. Power spectral density is in amplitude squared per cycle per day."

We could use `np.fft.rfft` which only calculates the positive frequencies, but since we will be working with complex inputs later, we will instead use `np.fft.fft` for everything, and sacrifice some efficiency."

    "Now, why do we get a PSD integral over the tide band of approximately 1, and PS max values of 0.5?  Recall that our fake tide is being generated with two sinusoids of unit amplitude.  The variance contributed by each is 0.5, hence the PS max value.  Integrating over the tidal band we have the sum of the two variances, hence 1."
