Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely used approaches to time series forecasting, and provide complementary approaches to the problem. While exponential smoothing models are based on a description of the trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data."

    "A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed. Thus, time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary — the trend and seasonality will affect the value of the time series at different times. On the other hand, a white noise series is stationary — it does not matter when you observe it, it should look much the same at any point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some cases can be confusing — a time series with cyclic behaviour (but with no trend or seasonality) is stationary. This is because the cycles are not of a fixed length, so before we observe the series we cannot be sure where the peaks and troughs of the cycles will be.\n",

The usefulness of partial autocorrelations may be understood in the following example. Suppose there is significant autocorrelation between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-1}$. This implies that there is also significant correlation between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-2}$, since they are one time step apart. There is therefore significant autocorrelation between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-2}$, because they are both correlated with $Y_{t-1}$. However, it can only be known if there is an independent relationship between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-2}$ if the effect of $Y_{t-1}$ can be partially out.

    "For an **MA(1)** model, typically the **ACF** shows only one peak in the ACF at lag 1, while the **PACF** shows partial autocorrelations dying down to zero. With real-life or empirical data, random effects will give a slightly more varied picture, as with the higher variance example above. Thus it can be seen that the **MA(1)** model is a mirror image of the **AR(1)** model, as far as the ACF and PACF are concerned.\n",
